* **Source 1**: [Rasberry Pi Weather Monitor System] (https://fastercapital.com/content/Weather-Station--Building-Your-Own-Weather-Monitoring-System-with-RPi.html)
  It shows us how to build a reasonable low cost weather monitoring system using rasbery pi. This breaks down many posible components, though process, and procedure as to how to build the system with lots of different variations. It's not a one path guide, its a guide with alternatives provided also.
  
* **Source 2**: [Ambirent Weather Mointoring System] (https://ambientweather.com/amws1965-wifi-weather-station-with-remote-monitoring)
This provides us a list of ambient weather monitoring systems all marked at different prices and levels. So now we can compare models and figure what level monitoring system we would like to build, also we can see how these products are marketed to see how do we make our monitor system also appeal to the consumer.

* **Source 3**:[Arduino Weather Station projects](https://www.instructables.com/Weather-Station-Projects/)
  This provides us with many subsystems that we can use in our monitoring system, such as wireless thermometer or a temperature logger. This will be a alarge system composed of amny sub systems that comes together, because monitoring the weather calls for us to measure many different things and keep record of it.

  
* **Source 4**: [Local Weather Station Design] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10675263/)
  This is helpful in that it covers weather analytics, sustainable monitoring, atmospheric data, predictive modeling, data collaboration, sensor networks. This document covers the understanding of the issue and why we are doing this project, along with many details about how weather monitoring works and whats needed to do that.

**Context:** Weather stations that were reviewed for the best going into 2024. This can help us understand what kind of designs are out there, whats used, how it used, what materials and parts are integrated into the machine.

**Source 2:** Veganic Agriculture Network. Microclimates [link](https://goveganic.net/how-to-grow/approaches-to-veganic/permaculture/microclimates/)   
**Context:** Gives basic and useful information about microclimates, how they can be observed and created. May be beneficial in understanding what data to collect on microclimates.

**Source 3:** Field Study Council. Microclimate [link](https://www.field-studies-council.org/resources/16-18-biology/fieldwork-techniques/abiotic-factors/microclimate/)   
**Context:** A more simple version of microclimate information but still could be useful in understanding the how and what data needs to be collected.
